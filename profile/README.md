# Introduction

Thank you for visiting the Swift Swap Ⓟ repository! We are an organization dedicated to solving Westlake High School's parking problem. WHS, being landlocked, faces the challenge of limited space for expanding and adding more parking lots. To tackle this issue, we have come up with an innovative solution called Swift Swap Ⓟ.

# About Swift Swap Ⓟ

Swift Swap Ⓟ is a platform designed to help students trade parking spots on the WHS campus efficiently and conveniently. We aim to alleviate parking congestion by encouraging voluntary student spot exchanges. By offering a platform for spot swapping, we hope to optimize parking space utilization and reduce parking-related frustrations.

# How It Works

Spot Listing: Students can list the parking spots that they are willing to trade on the Swift Swap Ⓟ platform. They can specify the time slots when their spot is available for trading.

Spot Searching: Students in need of parking can search for available spots during specific time slots that suit their schedule.

Match and Swap: When a suitable match is found, the students can then pay and swap through the platform.

Community Ratings: To ensure a positive experience, students can provide ratings and feedback after each swap.
